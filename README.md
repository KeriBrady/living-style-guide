# Living Style Guide

This project required creating a style guide for an existing website, based on their existing module and element styles. The idea is based off of style guides like [Primer](primercss.io) and Mail Chimp's [style guide](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns), and would hypothetically be something for UI developers at the website's offices to use for reference when building out pages.

I chose [Peach](https://www.peachd.com/), a young company that does inexpensive food delivery service to companies in the Seattle area. I used their website for inspiration in styling, and but deviated a bit to follow HTML best practices.

To build out the style guide, I used the Node.js platform with Express as the framework, built the views with Jade, styled with Sass and CSS, and used the Jeet grid system.

# Living Style Guide

This project required creating a style guide for an existing website, based on their existing module and element styles. The idea is based off of style guides like [Primer](http://primercss.io/) and Mail Chimp's [style guide](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns), and would hypothetically be something for UI developers at the website's offices to use for reference when building out pages.

I chose [Peach](https://www.peachd.com/), a young company that does inexpensive food delivery service to companies in the Seattle area. I used their website for inspiration in styling, and but deviated a bit to follow HTML best practices.

To build out the style guide, I used the Node.js platform with Express as the framework, built the views with Jade, styled with Sass and CSS, and used the Jeet grid system.

The live site is hosted on Heroku here: [peach-style-guide.herokuapp.com](https://peach-style-guide.herokuapp.com/)
